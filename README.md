# <Portfolio-challenge>

## Description
- For this project I was tasked to create a webpage as a portfolio from scratch using semantic HTML elements and CSS.
- My motivation for this project was so I can be able to further understand CSS since this project had me really pulling my hair out near the end trying to figure things out.
- The reason I built and edited this assignment was because I need a portfolio to be able to use and edit in the future.
- During this project I learned how to problem solve on my own by using resources such as google and AI tools to give me a better understanding of things I just cant seem to grasp, and comparing code with other code I already had to see why something did or did not work.
